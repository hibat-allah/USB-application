# Docker 
To run the docker container you need to run this command in cmd in the repo folder:

`` docker-compose up --build ``

And if you change the sript.js file or anything else, u must delete first the containter and build again.
if you didn't change anything and you stoped the container to run it again use:
`` docker-compose up ``
