To run the docker, you need first to install docker disktop for windows. And download this folder in an known location.<br />
For running the docker, you just need to open the cmd window in the path of the folder downloaded, and tap this command:

````c
docker-compose up --build
````
To build the container and image from the folder. 

If you already have the container and image built, you can directly run it using:

````css
docker-compose up
````
To do this you must have an internet connection so the code can download or update the antivirus CalmAV.
